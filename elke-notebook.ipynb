    "This is a tutoriol on how to use the Python library Dask. Dask is a tool to scale data libraries in Python such as Numpy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn. This means that smaller libraries can be scaled to used on big data. Dask can be deployed anywhere, so users can start on a laptop and scale up to cloud computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visit https://www.dask.org/ to learn more about Dask.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why use Dask?\n",
    "Dask can be used when working with big data sets. Environmental data scientists may encounter big data sets frequently. But why do we need to use dask? \n",
    "\n",
    "**\"Big data is data sets that are so voluminous and complex that traditional data processing application software are inadequate to deal with them.\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "Libraries such as Numpy and Pandas aren't built to handle big data sets. Dask works with Numpy and Pandas under the hood to run familiar functions on large sets of data. The maintainers of Dask are the same maintainers of Numpy and Pandas."
